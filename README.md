# Life-Expectancy
There is limited understanding of the relationship between life expectancy, immunizations, alcohol consumption, and Body Mass Index (BMI). This study aims to analyze the significance of immunizations, alcohol consumption, and BMI on life expectancy in at least three countries between 2000 and 2015.

Few of the python libraries we would be using are as listed below:

1. Pandas 
2. NumPy 
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn 
5. SciPy 
6. scikit-learn 
7. Statsmodels 
8. TensorFlow 
9. Keras 
10. Apache Spark
